# About
A colelction of excercises for the free full stack course : https://fullstackopen.com/en
The full stack open course is a free course from the University of Helsinki. It teaches you about ReactJs, REST API built with Node.js, GraphQL, testing and MongoDb.

## future
Due to my own schoolwork and applications i paused the course for a bit. Since for me it is not about getting credits, but about exposing myself to differentsources of Full stack development and keep learning.
I inted to continue this around May 2020.
